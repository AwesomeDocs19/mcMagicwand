this is a magic wand plugin for minecraft. I worked on it with version 1.8 so it will probably work with some later versions but not too many.

## how to use

First, compile it into a jar with java

then load it with forge

## Magic wand

Once you have them item, right click in the air or on a block to summon the magic effect
